### Hi there

I am Max, a **Back End Developer**, who is passionate about everything programming related and eager to work in a team to create production scale web applications.
In the past I used to build game plugins with IoT features, desktop applications, Telegram and Discord bots for MMORPG factions, web scrappers and old-school game mechanics in Unity and Python.

Currently working at **Railsware** as a **Python full-stack dev**
